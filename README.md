Created for a meeting in Sept 2019.

NOTES: 
* Sound does not work when using the version deployed on shinyapps.io. Download and run to get the sound to work.
* (Why doesn't sound work? "There is no cloud, only someone else's computer". I.e. sound is trying to play on a server somewhere where there is no audio.)
* _Potential future improvement: use javascript to play sound through the browser._
